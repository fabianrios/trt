        <h3>TRT TV PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
        <p>TRT TV is strongly committed to protecting your privacy and providing a safe online experience for all
        of our users while offering the highest quality media to them. Because we gather certain types of
        information about and from users so that we can fulfill your requests and better serve your needs, we
        feel you should fully understand which information we collect, how we collect it and how we use it.
        This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, how to correct or change
        it, and what steps we take to safeguard personal information provided to us both online and offline.
        Please read the complete Privacy Policy below and contact us if you have any questions.</p>
        <h3>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</h3>
        <p>You can visit our website without giving us any personally identifiable information. In order to provide
        our users with the most efficient, enhanced, and personalized service, we request personal in certain
        circumstances, and also collect certain information automatically. For the convenience of our users, a
        user account includes all the collected personal information we may have, but you can update or
        correct your contact information or change your preferences about receiving offers and information
        from us at any time.</p>
        <h4>Information Users Volunteer</h4>
        <p>We collect personally identifiable information such as names, mailing addresses, and/or email
        addresses when you voluntary register at our website. Website visitors may register to receive our
        services such as, but not limited to access to TRT method videos, email updates, offers or promotions.
        Registration may also be requested in connection with certain surveys. Registration can be
        accomplished by submitting your email address, name, address and phone number. Our registration
        form will indicate what information is required and what information (if any) is optional. This information
        will be collected during registration on our site or in connection with specific services.</p>
        <h4>TRT TV</h4>
        <p>If you wish to register online to be accesible to TRT TV footages such as TRT TV videos, you must
        either establish a credit card account with us or go through a purchase order approval process. In
        addition to the customary information needed (full name, address), collection of additional personal
        information, such as your credit card number and credit card expiration date, or your purchase order
        number is necessary.</p>
        <h4>Information Collected Automatically</h4>
        <p>We also may collect your IP address, browser type, access times and referring website address. This
        helps facilitate your online experience at our website. In addition, we may use cookies to track usage
        patterns at our site. See below for more detail on cookies.</p>
        <h3>WHAT DO WE DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION?</h3>
        <h5>We use information you provide to fulfill your requests and improve our services.</h5>
        <p>We use personal information so that we may display or send custom, personalized content to our
        website visitors and to send newsletters, mail, emails, features, promotional material, surveys and
        other updates, information or offers to our users. A user may, at any time, opt out of receiving such
        information. We also use collected information to evaluate and administer our services, fulfill user
        requests, respond to any problems that may arise (such as delivery issues, difficulties in navigating
        our site or accessing certain features), as well as to gauge user trends to determine what services are
        most popular with users.</p>
        <p>Of course, we and our technical and fulfillment consultants use personal information to allow you to
        purchase services at our website. Rest assured that we have careful procedures to safeguard credit
        card data in connection with your transactions.</p>
        <h3>HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
        <p>Personal information is available to TRT TV and its and our technical and fulfillment consultants who
        make this site and our products and services available to you. We share your personal information
        with third parties only with your prior permission. The domain of the website is safeguarded by a SSL-
        certificate. All data submitted are sent encrypted.</p>
        <p>Registration is possible via Facebook and personal data can be obtained via Facebook.</p>
        <h4>TRT TV and Its Agents</h4>
        <p>TRT TV may access any personal information you provide for internal marketing purposes, including
        sending you notice of new publications, services we offer likely to be of interest. To facilitate services,
        TRT TV will cache your order information, and create an authorization with a merchant account (i.e.,
        your credit card company) if you use a credit card to make a purchase. There are many companies
        who may be required to assist TRT TV in making its services and website available to you. Web host
        firms and technical and database consultants may have access to personally identifiable information in
        the course of making our services available. All companies working for TRT TV must comply with our
        information collection, use and disclosure policies, and are not permitted to sell your information to
        third parties or to use it except as authorized by us and you, or as permitted or required by law.</p>
        <h4>Credit Card Companies</h4>
        <p>As in any transaction, your credit card company will receive relevant information about the services
        purchased, your name, and your billing address. TRT TV will not otherwise provide any personal data
        to your credit card company.</p>
        <h4>Important Note</h4>
        <p>We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent as needed to satisfy
        any law, regulation or legal request; to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible
        breaches of law; to protect the integrity of our site and our property; to protect the safety of our visitors
        or others; to fulfill your requests; or to cooperate in any legal investigation.</p>

        on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable

        sites operated by third parties. We offer links to third party sites so that you can conveniently visit our
        partners or locate other content likely to be of interest. We are not responsible for the content,
        practices or policies of sites operated by third parties and urge you to inquire about them before
        providing any personally identifiable information.</p>
        <h3>CHANGES IN CORPORATE STRUCTURE</h3>
        <p>In developing our business, we might sell certain assets, or the company, or parts of it, may be sold,
        merged or otherwise transferred. In such transactions, user information, whether personally
        identifiable or otherwise, may be one of the transferred assets.</p>
        <h3>PLACE OF SERVERS</h3>
        <p>Our websites and the servers that make these sites available worldwide are located in Northern
        Virginia, United States of America (AWS’s US-east-1). All matters relating to these sites are, primarily
        governed by the laws of The Netherlands and if this not possible as a result of local regulations, by the
        laws of the state where the servers are established. Any information you provide in registering or
        ordering at our website will be transferred to the servers. By visiting our sites and submitting
        information you authorize this transfer, processing and use.</p>
        <h3>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
        <p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy as necessary to protect our users and to comply with a
        changing environment. We recommend that you check the policy when you visit our site to be sure
        you are aware of and understand our current policy. If we make material changes to this policy or in
        how we will use or collect your personally identifiable information, we will prominently post such
        changes prior to implementing the change. We will not make material changes in how we handle
        previously collected personal information that have retroactive effect unless legally required to do so,
        and we will email registered website visitors information on material changes to this policy.</p>
